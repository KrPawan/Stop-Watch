Stop Watch License Agreement

1. This is an agreement between Licensor and Licensee, who is being licensed to use the stopwatch app.

2. Licensee acknowledges that this is only a limited nonexclusive license. Licensor is and remains the owner of all titles, rights, and interests in the app.

3. This License permits Licensee to install the app on more than one computer system, as long as the app will not be used on more than one computer system simultaneously. Licensee will not make copies of the app or allow copies of the app to be made by others, unless authorized by this License Agreement. Licensee may make copies of the app for backup purposes only.

4. This app is subject to a limited warranty. Licensor warrants to Licensee that the physical medium on which this app is distributed is free from defects in materials and workmanship under normal use, the app will perform according to its printed documentation, and to the best of Licensor's knowledge Licensee's use of this app according to the printed documentation is not an infringement of any third party's intellectual property rights. This limited warranty lasts for a period of ____ days after delivery. To the extent permitted by law, THE ABOVE-STATED LIMITED WARRANTY REPLACES ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AND LICENSOR DISCLAIMS ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. No agent of Licensor is authorized to make any other warranties or to modify this limited warranty. Any action for breach of this limited warranty must be commenced within one year of the expiration of the warranty. Because some jurisdictions do not allow any limit on the length of an implied warranty, the above limitation may not apply to this Licensee. If the law does not allow disclaimer of implied warranties, then any implied warranty is limited to ____ days after delivery of the app to Licensee. Licensee has specific legal rights pursuant to this warranty and, depending on Licensee's jurisdiction, may have additional rights.

5. In case of a breach of the Limited Warranty, Licensee's exclusive remedy is as follows: Licensee will return all copies of the app to Licensor, at Licensee's cost, along with proof of purchase. (Licensee can obtain a step-by-step explanation of this procedure, including a return authorization code, by contacting Licensor at [address and toll free telephone number].) At Licensor's option, Licensor will either send Licensee a replacement copy of the app, at Licensor's expense, or issue a full refund.

6. Notwithstanding the foregoing, LICENSOR IS NOT LIABLE TO LICENSEE FOR ANY DAMAGES, INCLUDING COMPENSATORY, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, CONNECTED WITH OR RESULTING FROM THIS LICENSE AGREEMENT OR LICENSEE'S USE OF THIS app. Licensee's jurisdiction may not allow such a limitation of damages, so this limitation may not apply.

7. Licensee agrees to defend and indemnify Licensor and hold Licensor harmless from all claims, losses, damages, complaints, or expenses connected with or resulting from Licensee's business operations.

8. Licensor has the right to terminate this License Agreement and Licensee's right to use this app upon any material breach by Licensee.

9. Licensee agrees to return to Licensor or to destroy all copies of the app upon termination of the License.

10. This License Agreement is the entire and exclusive agreement between Licensor and Licensee regarding this app. This License Agreement replaces and supersedes all prior negotiations, dealings, and agreements between Licensor and Licensee regarding this app.

11. This License Agreement is governed by the law of [State] applicable to [State] contracts.

12. This License Agreement is valid without Licensor's signature. It becomes effective upon the earlier of Licensee's signature or Licensee's use of the app.
